#0.3
- Added a scrollbar for all xterm sessions

#0.3.1
- Changed the way that SoftAPs and the DHCP server interact with each other.  The user may now launch a SoftAP independent of a DHCP server; however, an autolaunch option is provided in the SoftAP menu that will speed up the process for a quick launch of full routing capabilities.  As well, this change allowed for the user to launch a dhcp server on any NIC they choose.
 
- Added the option to tail the DHCP log so that Hostnames of users are shown.

#0.3.3
- Added in customized DNS entry option for the DHCP Server.  In a later version this option will be entered with new lines, right now it it a one variable method where each IP is split by a space versus by pressing enter...

#0.3.5
- Added a function that verifies a NIC exists prior to trying to use it.
- Removed a lot of needless "While Loops"

#0.5
- Added in a function that allows the user to arpspoof multiple targets in one swoop
