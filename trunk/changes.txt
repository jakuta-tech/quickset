Current Version: 2.0

Changes:
#0.3
- Added a scrollbar for all xterm sessions

#0.3.1
- Changed the way that SoftAPs and the DHCP server interact with each other.  The user may now launch a SoftAP independent of a DHCP server; however, an autolaunch option is provided in the SoftAP menu that will speed up the process for a quick launch of full routing capabilities.  As well, this change allowed for the user to launch a dhcp server on any NIC they choose.
 
- Added the option to tail the DHCP log so that Hostnames of users are shown.

#0.3.3
- Added in customized DNS entry option for the DHCP Server.  In a later version this option will be entered with new lines, right now it it a one variable method where each IP is split by a space versus by pressing enter...

#0.3.5
- Added a function that verifies a NIC exists prior to trying to use it.
- Removed a lot of needless "While Loops"

#0.5
- Added in a function that allows the user to arpspoof multiple targets in one swoop

#0.7
- Added an Updating Function for the script

#0.7.1
- Added in functionality that will kill the Parent "quickset.sh" if update is launched and successful.  Prior to this, if a trap INT was called within the child, the user would be reverted back to the parent once exiting out of the child; this could be very confusing and took away the "beauty" of this script.  It's also something that I have not seen with any script which relaunches itself after updating....

#0.9
- All varibles that were used for "String" comparasions have been sanitized with double quotations
- The previous "amplification techniques" function has been removed in favor of:
  1) My idea on "Amplification" was incorrect.  Thank you for pointing out the defencies ShadowMaster.
  2) A completly restructured wifi_101--(), which enables the user to perform each step in the WEP crack process one by one; while still retaining the "Automated" features that previous versions contained.
- Some functions were combined when I realized that they did the same thing in a slightly different manner.
- An option has been added in both the Authentication function and the Packetforge-NG functions of the script that will allow the user to do SKA injection.

#1.3
- Fixed the bug for wifi_auth--() pointing to auth--()
- Fixed a bug with regards to ifconfig -s for dev_check--()
- Added xterm option for chop & frag
- Adjusted dhcpd with 1hr lease and 2hr max
- Added color to main menu to allure to the fact that 2) shouldnt be entered in
- Added directory location in titlebar for dhcpdtail
- began debugging with an actual router, fixing massive problems.........
- removed Wireless Channel Recon option in favor of consolidated wifi options under wifi_101--()
- Added exit option within init_setup--()

#1.5
- killall -9 replaced killall for dhcpcd kill called during "Hidden Processes" kill when exiting the script
- init_setup--() simplified
- Automated WEP attacks menu removed, read comments for full explanation
- Seems to be fully debugged for the wifi_101--() portion of quickset.sh
- Still waiting on a fix for airbase-ng to prevent the segmentation fault, hence the odd versioning sequences

#1.7
- Moved iptables functions to routing menu
- Added in sleeps to allow user to read and comprehend the tables versus the old way of having them scrollback to read
- Added proper coloring for iptable-save outputs
- Went through and symetricized menu options
- Adjusted sleep timings on some menu options
- Added returns within functions to breakout of "Enable || Kill" Monitor Mode options so that if the user inadvertently picks those options, they are $
- Small changes to variable naming for speed purposes

#2.0
- Modified default MTU setting for routing purposes to 1400
- Clarified password settings for WiFi Extender
- Removed gateway warnings for Wireless Vaccuum/Stickypot/WiFi Extender.  Didn't like how it looked.  This will now require the user to know a little something about how their system is set up; but then again, quickset is not for skiddies.....
- Modified Kill/Enable monitor mode settings to prevent a loop trap, thereby allowing a user to null the entry if they dont want to do it.
- Slight modification of the Ferret menu for symetrics.....

#2.1
- Added DNSspoof'ing capabilities
- quickset.sh has been "patched" odd numbered version control untill DNSspoof custom host capability is functional 
- Rearranged Quick Attack Menu
- Modified a couple of functions to use "sleep 1" -vs- read for 'speed and intensity purposes'
- Modified dev_check--() fail timer to 1 second for readibility purposes
- Changed "Proceed" option to "Continue" for usability.  Prior method was a numbered system to where the higher decimal number would be the option to continue on.  It was decided to use a constant variable as a method versus a changing number.
- Removal of letters enclosed with () for readibility
- Exchange of backquotes for $() to prevent the user from seeing certain outputs
