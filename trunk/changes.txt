Current Version: 1.3

Changes:
#0.3
- Added a scrollbar for all xterm sessions

#0.3.1
- Changed the way that SoftAPs and the DHCP server interact with each other.  The user may now launch a SoftAP independent of a DHCP server; however, an autolaunch option is provided in the SoftAP menu that will speed up the process for a quick launch of full routing capabilities.  As well, this change allowed for the user to launch a dhcp server on any NIC they choose.
 
- Added the option to tail the DHCP log so that Hostnames of users are shown.

#0.3.3
- Added in customized DNS entry option for the DHCP Server.  In a later version this option will be entered with new lines, right now it it a one variable method where each IP is split by a space versus by pressing enter...

#0.3.5
- Added a function that verifies a NIC exists prior to trying to use it.
- Removed a lot of needless "While Loops"

#0.5
- Added in a function that allows the user to arpspoof multiple targets in one swoop

#0.7
- Added an Updating Function for the script

#0.7.1
- Added in functionality that will kill the Parent "quickset.sh" if update is launched and successful.  Prior to this, if a trap INT was called within the child, the user would be reverted back to the parent once exiting out of the child; this could be very confusing and took away the "beauty" of this script.  It's also something that I have not seen with any script which relaunches itself after updating....

#0.9
- All varibles that were used for "String" comparasions have been sanitized with double quotations
- The previous "amplification techniques" function has been removed in favor of:
  1) My idea on "Amplification" was incorrect.  Thank you for pointing out the defencies ShadowMaster.
  2) A completly restructured wifi_101--(), which enables the user to perform each step in the WEP crack process one by one; while still retaining the "Automated" features that previous versions contained.
- Some functions were combined when I realized that they did the same thing in a slightly different manner.
- An option has been added in both the Authentication function and the Packetforge-NG functions of the script that will allow the user to do SKA injection.

#1.3
- Fixed the bug for wifi_auth--() pointing to auth--()
- Fixed a bug with regards to ifconfig -s for dev_check--()
- Added xterm option for chop & frag
- Adjusted dhcpd with 1hr lease and 2hr max
- Added color to main menu to allure to the fact that 2) shouldnt be entered in
- Added directory location in titlebar for dhcpdtail
- began debugging with an actual router, fixing massive problems.........
- removed Wireless Channel Recon option in favor of consolidated wifi options under wifi_101--()
